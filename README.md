# Tetris

Tetris is a favourite game of mine.

Having no game development exp, I followed a YouTube tutorial from a developer called Pontus.

Tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA), I highly recomend watching.

I have made personal touches since then.

I don't own the music, the rest you can do with as you please.
